                <p>during one of my monthly <abbr title="central business district">cbd</abbr> wanderings, my curiosity led me down an unfamiliar path, and there it was, a building i had never seen before; one that seemed to beckon me closer. the structure loomed over me, a seemingly mundane seven-story multi-level carpark. it seemed fairly empty, with only a few cars visible from the outside. empty, but clearly not abandoned.</p>

                <p>as i approached, i noticed something odd about the top of the building; a massive concrete structure perched on the roof, embedded with tall glass windows, and adorned with a collection of cell towers. its exterior walls were covered in indecipherable graffiti.</p>

                <p>hesitating a little, i ventured within via the main entrance.</p>

                <img src="notes/images/evilbuilding.png" alt="an illustration of large parking garage with a strange concrete structure on top">

                <p>as i entered, the smell of stagnant water struck my nostrils. the interior was brightly lit, but paradoxically dark, as if the flickering fluorescent tubes only served to thicken the shadows.</p>

                <p>almost immediately after entering, i sensed movement in my peripheral vision. there was a security guard moving to block my path; i quickened my pace to avoid confrontation, and he seemed to give up almost immediately. as i continued up the ramp to the first storey, i saw him settle back into his office chair, engrossed in his mobile phone.</p>

                <p>i steadily continued up the building; it seemed taller than it did from the outside. then i noticed something strange. there were no cars anywhere. i swore i could see some from the outside, but it didn't matter. i had to make it to the top.</p>
               
                <p>as i climbed the seemingly unending ramps and stairwells of the structure, i felt a sense of dread building within me. it felt as if a great pressure was crushing my head, but despite my better judgement, i continued upward, until finally i reached the top.</p>

                <p>at the building's peak was where the negative aura was strongest. the air felt thick with an evil energy that made my skin crawl, as if i were being watched by a thousand eyes.</p>

                <p>the view from the top was interesting, but it was not the time to take in the sights. i looked around for an entrance to the concrete block above me, but there was none.</p>

                <p>somewhat disappointed, i leaned against the railing and looked down at the people on the street.</p>

                <p>it was beginning time to leave, so i picked up my bag again and turned around, taking a last look at the colossal block of concrete above me.</p>

                <p>and there was someone looking down at me.</p>

                <p>he was wearing a black suit and tie, and had a smug look on his face; as if he were taunting me. we met eyes for a moment, and he flicked his cigarette, disappearing from sight.</p>

                <p>i hastily descended the carpark floors, shocked as to what i had seen.</p>

                <p>as i left the building via the same entrance i came in, the security guard was nowhere to be seen. the negative energy of the building faded as soon as i left the carpark's threshold, like a massive weight had been lifted from my shoulders.</p>

                <p>when i went home, i searched online for any information on the building, but there was nothing. no records, no ownership, no reviews, no one asking what was inside. it was impossible to find a single sentence saying that the building was anything other than a regular old parking garage.</p>

                <p>i'll return to this building one day, probably with a really tall ladder. actually, now that i think of it, the entrance was probably at street-level anyway. i'll bring a really tall ladder regardless, just for the intimidation factor.</p>
