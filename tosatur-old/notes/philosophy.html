            <p>the following rant is more rant-y than usual, i apologise.</p>

            <p>i'm pretty tired of websites having a 1-10 megabyte file size per page, 90% of which is unneeded javascript libraries or giant, uncompressed images.</p>
            
            <p>i'm tired of web developers being determined to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">moore's law</a> irrelevant by not bothering to optimise their code.</p> 
            
            <p>i'm tired of programmers in general assuming everyone has fast internet access (or even internet access at all) by turning everything into a cloud-based web "application".</p>

            <p>this site will:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>always be purely static,</li>
                <li>be as lightweight as possible,</li>
                <li>never use unnecessary javascript,</li>
                <li>always prioritise accessibility,</li>
                <li>never deanonymise anyone,</li>
                <li>and never collect any data.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>why?</h2>

            <p>i'll explain each of these dot points in order:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>this site is pretty much just a blog, it doesn't need any dynamically generated content, because all content is pre-generated in my mind.</li>
                <li>not everyone has super fast, unmetered, reliable internet. for <a href="https://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters">some internet users</a>, a megabyte is a lot! it could mean the difference between a website being usable or taking forever to load. why should my website be bloated, and thus inaccessible to these users? it shouldn't. if you really want to, you can view this website entirely offline, although you would miss out on any new updates.</li>
                <li><a href="https://100r.co">some people</a> don't have a fast computer, or reliable electricity. for these people, frivolous use of javascript prevents them from using vast swathes of the web. i simply don't need javascript for this site, so i don't use it. writing software to be compatible with older or slower technology also minimises e-waste.</li>
                <li>making my website easier to use for people who need screen readers or other assistive technologies, or even just people who are viewing on a smaller screen is easy, so why not?</li>
                <li>simply, i value my anonymity, so i don't want to deanonymise anyone else.</li>
                <li>i don't need it! who gives a shit!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>i consider these points to be good design; i think my current website is a lot better than its previous iteration.</p>

            <p>sites like mine are unfortunately, increasingly uncommon on the internet. rather than building small, efficient, personal websites, the web has devolved into a slurry of "platforms", which seek to tame that which was once the wild west.</p>

            <h2>the dark forest</h2>

            <p>recently, i read an <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest">essay by maggie appleton</a> which talks about the "dark forest theory" of the web. to explain; when walking through a dark forest, it may seem devoid of animals, but of course, it is not. the dark forest is teeming with life, but this life is hiding from predators which may destroy it.</p>
            
            <p>if you swap out the predators for data harvesters, click-farmers, ai, bots, spammers, ads, and influencers, you can see how the dark forest is a pretty good analogy for the modern web.</p>

            <p>humans who want genuine, real "content" (as much as i abhore the term) have to hide within gatekept web-shelters, like discord servers or personal sites. although alternative protocols like <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">gemini</a> provide a space for simple websites made by genuine humans, the web is where everyone is at.</p>

            <p>the world wide web is in a sad state, but the sooner we accept it, the sooner we can act. personally, i've noticed an increase in people making their own websites; perhaps people are already accepting it?</p>

            <p>this is why i made my own website; to have my own space, not controlled by a platform, where it can be stolen, changed, or deleted at a conglomerate's whim. it is mine, mine alone, and so it will stay.</p>

            <p>if you are reading this and you don't have your own website, make one! it doesn't have to be good, or beautiful, or content-rich; what matters is that it's yours. making a website is cheap and easy, so why forfeit your independence to a corporation who's only obligation is to its shareholders?</p>
