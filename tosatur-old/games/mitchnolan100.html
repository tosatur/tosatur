            <p>mitch nolan simulator 100: the new world is a parkour racing game i made in 2021.</p>
            <p>the player has the ability to sprint, wallrun, jump, front flip, and grab onto ledges.</p>
            <p>it was intended as a reboot of the mitch nolan series; (this is somewhat meaningless as every entry in the mitch nolan franchise was completely disconnected from the rest in both genre, gameplay, and "plot.") i had the idea for this game in the shower.</p>
