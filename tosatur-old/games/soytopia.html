            <p>soytopia is an open world rpg that is currently in development. it will likely take me the rest of my natural life to complete. i cannot explain any further.</p>

            <p>2023-05-31 @ 11:43pm update: i am working on remaking soytopia from scratch. the previous (5th? 6th?) version had potential but was unfocused and thus didn't fit my vision of what the game should be. i have a long list of ideas which i need to whittle down before beginning work on it again, lest feature creep rear its ugly head.</p>
