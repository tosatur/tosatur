            <p>the second version of the <a href="dukeellington.html">original aidscore track</a>. i made this version because the <a href="https://www.amuse.io/en/">app</a> i was using to publish music to <a href="https://spotify.com">spotify</a> didn't allow tracks under <abbr title="2 minutes and 30 seconds">2:30</abbr> in length. 
                it also had a bunch of other weird restrictions, like preventing you from putting any text on your album cover other than the name of the album or your artist name. i stopped using that app and publishing my music to spotify soon after. this song also sucks complete ass.</p>

            <p>released <time>2018-09-20</time>.</p>
