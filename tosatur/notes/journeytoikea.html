            <p>in melbourne, australia, there are 2 ikeas. one in richmond, and one in springvale. at the time, i had no car, and i didn't know that the richmond one existed, so i decided to go to ikea in springvale, which was much further.</p>
            <p>doing so required the use of public transport. in the early hours of the day, i hopped on the bus, and made my way to ikea.</p>
            <img src="notes/images/mapofmelbourne.png" alt="a crudely drawn map of melbourne, australia.">
            <p>the journey there was unbelievably boring. so boring, it felt like i had transcended the confines of my earthly body, and ascended to a realm of pure nothingness. i percieved nothing, i was not there.</p>
            <p>the bus stops came and went. templestowe. doncaster. blackburn. glen waverley. people boarded and disembarked, but through all their micro-journeys, i was there, at the back of the bus. no music, no headphones. sitting. waiting.</p>
            <p>now that i think about it, i don't know why i subjected myself to such mind-numbing boredom. i had my phone and headphones on me the entire time.</p>
            <p>what snapped me out of my meditative trance was an old asian man entering the bus, around the halfway point of my journey. after a brief word with the driver, he came to the back of the bus and sat across from me.</p>
            <p>when i tried to re-enter my state of pure unfocus, i spotted movement in my peripheral vision. i turned, and i saw the old man showing me his phone. on the screen was a wordpress site with a red ornate background.</p>
            <p>"my poetry," he said.</p>
            <p>i looked at him, then back to the screen.</p>
            <p>"cool," i replied. "did you make this?"</p>
            <p>"my daughter," he said, scrolling down the page, showing me all his poems, but too fast for me to be able to read any.</p>
            <p>after a brief conversation, the old man reached his stop. as i watched him walk down the footpath through the bus's windows, i realised something.</p>
            <p>i forgot to ask for the url.</p>
            <p>if the poet in question is reading this somehow, please send me the link to your cool site. thank you.</p>
            <p>anyway, after many hours (2), and many kilometres (42), i got off at my stop. from there, there was about a 20 minute walk before finally reaching ikea. as i trekked through the final leg of my journey, i walked past a pile of kids' tricycles. i considered commandeering one, to assist me on my quest, but i decided against it, because there was a scary man there.</p>
            <p>as clambered up the suburban hills, i saw it. a deep blue cube on the horizon. ikea. this is what columbus must have felt.</p>
            <p>but my prize was snatched away from me. i felt a vibration in my pocket, and a sense of dread filled my mind. my mum was ringing me. she told me to come home.</p>
            <p>devastated, i headed back to the bus stop. you may be asking; what was the reason for this epic, <i>7 years in tibet</i>-esque journey? the answer: none.</p>
