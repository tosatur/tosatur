            <h2>pro-fountain arguments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>fountains look nice</li>
                <li>evaporative cooling for the surrounding area</li>
                <li>calming ambience</li>
                <li>helpful for wildlife</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>anti-fountain arguments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>they waste water</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>rebuttal to idiotic anti-fountain arguments</h2>

            <p>fountains don't waste much water. as water is recycled through the pump once it comes out the top of the fountain, the only way for the fountain to lose water is via evaporation, which as mentioned earlier, has practical benefits.</p>

            <h2>summary</h2>

            <p>fountains are great and melbourne doesn't have nearly enough of them.</p>
