                <p>here are a few common misconceptions about languages.</p>

                <h2>ghoti</h2>
                <p>it is often said that english spelling rules are so illogical that you could feasibly spell the word <i>fish</i> as <i>ghoti</i>. the reasoning is this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>gh from <i>enough</i></li>
                    <li>o from <i>women</i></li>
                    <li>ti from <i>nation</i></li>
                </ul>

                <p>put these together and you get <i>ghoti</i>. obviously, this is untrue. there is a reason why you automatically pronounce ghoti similarly to goatee; english spelling rules simply don't work like that.</p>

                <p>while it is true (and maybe illogical) that these spellings make such sounds, they only make these sounds in specific parts of a word. this concept, known as <i>phonotactics</i>, explains away this misconception.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>gh only sounds like <i>f</i> when following <i>ou</i> or <i>au</i></li>
                    <li>o is really only pronounced <i>i</i> in the word <i>women</i></li>
                    <li>ti only sounds like <i>sh</i> when followed by a vowel</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>inuit has many words for snow</h2>
                <p>this one is pretty ambiguous, but the idea is that, because inuit peoples are around snow a lot, they have more words for it.</p>

                <p>whether you believe this or not depends on your definition of <i>word</i>. the original claim comes from franz boas, who, in his study of eskimo-aleut languages in canada, found that </p>
