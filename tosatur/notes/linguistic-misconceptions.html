                <p>here are a few common misconceptions about languages.</p>

                <h2>ghoti</h2>
                <p>it is often said that english spelling rules are so illogical that you could feasibly spell the word <i>fish</i> as <i>ghoti</i>. the reasoning is this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>gh from <i>enough</i></li>
                    <li>o from <i>women</i></li>
                    <li>ti from <i>nation</i></li>
                </ul>

                <p>put these together and you get <i>ghoti</i>. obviously, this is untrue. there is a reason why you automatically pronounce ghoti similarly to goatee; english spelling rules simply don't work like that.</p>

                <p>while it is true (and maybe illogical) that these spellings make such sounds, they only make these sounds in specific parts of a word. this concept, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics"><i>phonotactics</i></a>, explains away this misconception.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>gh only sounds like <i>f</i> when following <i>ou</i> or <i>au</i></li>
                    <li>o is only pronounced <i>i</i> in the word <i>women</i></li>
                    <li>ti only sounds like <i>sh</i> when followed by a vowel</li>
                </ul>

                <p>you could however, write the word <i>fish</i> as <i>pfysche</i>.</p>

                <h2>inuit has many words for snow</h2>
                <p>this one is pretty ambiguous, but the idea is that, because inuit peoples are around snow a lot, they have more words for it.</p>

                <p>the original claim comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas">franz boas</a>, who, in his study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskaleut_languages">eskaleut languages</a> in canada, found that they had around the same number of words for snow as english, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic_language">polysynthetic</a> nature of the language allows each word root to be modified to create greater nuance. this means that noun-adjective pairs, and even entire sentences can be expressed as single words in these languages.</p>

                <p>depending on how you define <i>word</i>, you could say that inuit languages have a not-exceptional number of words for snow, or that they have a near infinite amount.</p>

                <p>on a related note, english actually has 12-40 words that can mean snow, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi_languages">sami languages</a> in northern scandinavia have been found to have as many as 300 words for snow, and as many as 1000 words for reindeer.</p>

                <h2>made up words</h2>
                <p>another common one i've seen is people (like <a href="https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwritingcooperative.com%2F5-words-that-don-t-exist-and-5-weird-ones-that-do-d5caa5c0aabc">this</a> article) confidently stating that certain words are "not a word."</p>

                <p>the selection of words that some claim are fake is completely arbitrary, but are often slang terms, or perceived grammatical errors. at risk of catastrophically dating this post, i'll list a few below.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><i>rizz</i></li>
                    <li><i>irregardless</i></li>
                    <li><i>ain't</i></li>
                    <li><i>orientate</i></li>
                    <li><i>ginormous</i></li>
                    <li><i>funner</i></li>
                </ul>

                <p>all words are made up, if a word is in common use but isn't in a dictionary, that is a failure of the dictionary.</p>
