            <p>chairpusher is the earliest published "game" i've made. it is a "game" in which you push chairs off a platform.</p>

            <p>this game was made out of pure rage. out of frustration of not being able to complete a game project, i created the worst, most pointless, least effort-taking game ever.</p>

            <p>all you can do is pick up chairs, push them around, and throw them off the platform. once any object (including the player) falls around 100m below the platform, a toilet flushing sound is played, and the game crashes. there is also a floating <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnmovingPlaid">chowder</a> bean orb.</p>

            <p>the filesize is a whopping <abbr title="380,000,000 bytes">380mb</abbr>. sorry about that; i accidentally left in the default unreal engine starter content.</p>
