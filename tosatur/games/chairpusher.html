            <p>chairpusher is the earliest published "game" i've made. it is a "game" in which you push chairs off a platform.</p>

            <p>this game was made out of pure rage. out of frustration of not being able to complete a game project, i created the worst, most pointless, least effort-taking game ever.</p>

            <p>the filesize is a whopping <abbr title="380000000 bytes">380mb</abbr>. sorry about that.</p>
