            <p>attention: this site and all its content was made by a human! there was no bot, ai, or web-demon involved in the creation of this site! only humans may view this site! all silicon-based entities, turn away now!</p>

            <p>this is the personal website of the web-user tosatur. tosatur is a game developer, amateur linguist, bane of all with pitch-perfection, armchair mountaineer, lowercase enthusiast and pro-email activist. tosatur will henceforth speak in the first-person.</p>

            <p>the previous version of this site was riddled with javascript and external dependencies. i apologise to all who stumbled upon it, it was not my intention to plague your browser with such a terrible experience.</p>

            <p>the new version of this site is written entirely in plain <abbr title="hypertext markup language">html</abbr>, no bells and whistles, just raw text.</p>

            <p>i've tried to adhere to the <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> group of standards as much as possible while making this site.</p>

            <p>please <a href="contact/index.html">contact</a> me if there are any bugs/issues/mistakes in this humble web-zone.</p>

            <p>the repository for this site can be seen <a href=https://github.com/tosatur/tosatur">here</a>.</p>
